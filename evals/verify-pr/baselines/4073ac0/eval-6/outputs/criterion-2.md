| eval-3 | 11/13 | 2 | 85% |
| eval-4 | 10/10 | 0 | 100% |
| eval-5 | 10/10 | 0 | 100% |

### Failing assertion details for eval-3

**Assertion 1:**
- **Text:** "Convention upgrade eligibility is evaluated for review comment 30002 (index suggestion) -- the review classification output (review-30002.md) or the report's Style/Conventions analysis explains whether the suggestion matches a documented or demonstrated project convention"
- **Evidence:** "The output file review-30002.md classifies the comment as a suggestion but does not evaluate convention upgrade eligibility -- no CONVENTIONS.md lookup or codebase pattern analysis is documented in the classification reasoning"

**Assertion 2:**
- **Text:** "Review comment 30002 (index suggestion) results in a sub-task regardless of classification path -- whether classified directly as code change request based on reviewer language, or upgraded from suggestion via convention analysis"
- **Evidence:** "No sub-task was created for review comment 30002 -- it was classified as suggestion and no convention upgrade was attempted, so the suggestion was not elevated to a code change request"

Both failing assertions are from eval-3, which has 2 failures out of 13 total assertions (85% pass rate). No other evals have failing assertions.
