# Remediation — CVE-2026-55123 (tokio)

## Triage Outcome

- **Case A**: Affected — create remediation tasks for stream rhtpa-2.2 (in scope)
- **Case B**: Cross-stream impact — create preemptive remediation tasks for stream rhtpa-2.1 (no CVE Jira exists)

Since tokio is a **Cargo** (source dependency) ecosystem, each stream requires **two** tasks: an upstream backport task and a downstream propagation subtask.

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.2 (Current Stream)

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.2)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`

**Link**: Depend on TC-8020

#### Description

## Repository

rhtpa-backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-55123: use-after-free in task abort in tokio.
The vulnerable dependency (tokio < 1.42.0) must be updated
to the fixed version (1.42.0+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1
Source commit(s): v0.4.5 (2.2.0), v0.4.8 (2.2.1)

Upstream fix: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7001
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-tk91-v5pp

## Implementation Notes

- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- **Dependency type**: direct (or transitive — to be confirmed via Cargo.lock inspection)
- Update tokio dependency to >= 1.42.0 in Cargo.toml / Cargo.lock

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy before
discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokio dependency is >= 1.42.0
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (rhtpa-2.2)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update rhtpa-backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`

**Links**:
- Depend on TC-8020
- Blocked by upstream backport task (Task 1)

#### Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update rhtpa-backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-55123 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps tokio to 1.42.0
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- **Dependency type**: carried forward from upstream task
- Update the rhtpa-backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] rhtpa-backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.1

These tasks are created proactively because stream rhtpa-2.1 is affected but has no CVE Jira.

### Task 3: Preemptive Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.1)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.1)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`, `security-preemptive`

**Link**: Related to TC-8020 (not Depend — originating CVE belongs to a different stream)

#### Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8020 (stream rhtpa-2.2).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
