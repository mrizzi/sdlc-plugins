## Stream Scope Resolution

- Summary suffix: `[rhtpa-2.2]`
- Mapped stream: **2.2.x** (Konflux release repo: `git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`)
- Issue is **stream-scoped** to 2.2.x. Steps 3 and 4 will be scoped to this stream; cross-stream impact on 2.1.x is handled via Case B.

## Ecosystem Detection

- Library: quinn-proto (Rust crate)
- Ecosystem: **Cargo**
- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`
- This is a source dependency ecosystem -- remediation will produce 2 tasks (upstream backport + downstream propagation).

## Deployment Context

- Repository `rhtpa-backend` found in Source Repositories table
- Deployment context: **upstream** (default -- no Deployment Context column present in Source Repositories table)

## Vulnerability Description

The quinn-proto crate before version 0.11.14 allows a remote attacker to cause a panic by sending a QUIC transport frame that creates an excessive number of streams. This vulnerability is classified as a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability exists because quinn-proto does not properly validate the number of streams requested in a STREAMS frame.
