## Stream Scope Resolution

- Summary suffix: `[rhtpa-2.2]`
- Mapped stream: **2.2.x**
- Matching Version Stream: `rhtpa-release.0.4.z` at `/home/dev/repos/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`

The issue is **scoped** to stream 2.2.x. Steps 3-8 apply only to versions within the 2.2.x stream for this issue. Cross-stream impact (2.1.x) is handled via Case B.

## Ecosystem Detection

- Library: quinn-proto (Rust crate)
- Ecosystem: **Cargo**
- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`
- Source repository: rhtpa-backend (upstream)

## Affects Versions Mismatch

The PSIRT-assigned Affects Version is **RHTPA 2.0.0**, but no `2.0.x` stream exists in the Security Configuration. The Version Streams table defines only `2.1.x` and `2.2.x`. This is an incorrect Affects Version that must be corrected in Step 3.
