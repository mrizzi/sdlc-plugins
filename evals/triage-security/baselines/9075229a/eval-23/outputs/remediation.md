# Step 8 -- Remediation: TC-8001

## Triage Outcome

**Case A** (Affected): Versions 2.2.0, 2.2.1, and 2.2.2 within the scoped 2.2.x stream ship quinn-proto < 0.11.14 and are affected by CVE-2026-31812.

**Case B** (Cross-stream impact): Versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 in the 2.1.x stream also ship quinn-proto 0.11.9, which is within the affected range. Cross-stream impact must be reported.

**Ecosystem**: Cargo (source dependency) -- requires two remediation tasks: upstream backport + downstream propagation.

## Remediation Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x stream)

### Jira Issue Creation

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.2.x)",
  description: <see description below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-31812"]
)
```

### Task Description

## Repository

rhtpa-backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.2.0 (v0.4.5), 2.2.1 (v0.4.8), 2.2.2 (retag of v0.4.8)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is shipped to customers. Coordinate with Product Security for CVE assignment, advisory preparation, and formal disclosure. Fix must be released via a security advisory with explicit CVE-to-component mapping.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

## Remediation Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x stream)

### Jira Issue Creation

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update rhtpa-backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (2.2.x)",
  description: <see description below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-31812"]
)
```

### Task Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update rhtpa-backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- Update the rhtpa-backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

### Coordination Guidance

This component is shipped to customers. Coordinate with Product Security for CVE assignment, advisory preparation, and formal disclosure. Fix must be released via a security advisory with explicit CVE-to-component mapping.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] rhtpa-backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

## Jira Linkage

After task creation:

1. Link upstream backport task to TC-8001:
   ```
   jira.create_link(inwardIssue: "TC-8001", outwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>, type: "Depend")
   ```

2. Link downstream propagation task to TC-8001:
   ```
   jira.create_link(inwardIssue: "TC-8001", outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>, type: "Depend")
   ```

3. Link downstream blocked by upstream:
   ```
   jira.create_link(inwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>, outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>, type: "Blocks")
   ```

4. Transition TC-8001 to In Progress.

---

## Cross-Stream Impact (Case B)

### Cross-Stream Impact Comment on TC-8001

```
Cross-stream impact: quinn-proto < 0.11.14 also affects stream 2.1.x
based on lock file analysis.
- 2.1.0 (v0.3.8): quinn-proto 0.11.9
- 2.1.1 (v0.3.12): quinn-proto 0.11.9

These streams are tracked by companion issues (see Related links)
or may require separate PSIRT triage.
```

### Preemptive Remediation for 2.1.x Stream

Since the 2.1.x stream does not have its own CVE Jira for CVE-2026-31812, create preemptive remediation tasks.

#### Preemptive Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.1.x stream)

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.1.x)",
  description: <see description below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-31812", "security-preemptive"]
)
```

##### Task Description

jira.create_link(inwardIssue: <preemptive-upstream-task-key>, outwardIssue: <preemptive-downstream-task-key>, type: "Blocks")
```

### Preemptive Task Comment on TC-8001

```
Preemptive remediation tasks created for streams without CVE Jiras:
- 2.1.x: <preemptive-upstream-task-key> (security-preemptive, upstream backport)
- 2.1.x: <preemptive-downstream-task-key> (security-preemptive, downstream propagation)

These tasks use the "Related" link type and carry the security-preemptive
label. When PSIRT creates stream-specific CVE Jiras, Step 4.4
reconciliation will link them and remove the label.
```

## Coordination Guidance

All remediation tasks (both scoped and preemptive) include the following coordination guidance in their Implementation Notes, based on the `customer-shipped` deployment context of the rhtpa-backend repository:

> This component is shipped to customers. Coordinate with Product Security for CVE assignment, advisory preparation, and formal disclosure. Fix must be released via a security advisory with explicit CVE-to-component mapping.

This guidance is derived from the Deployment Context column in the Source Repositories table of the CLAUDE.md Security Configuration. The `customer-shipped` value triggers the most rigorous coordination requirements, ensuring that fixes go through formal disclosure and advisory processes.
