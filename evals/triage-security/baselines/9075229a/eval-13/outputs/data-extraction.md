## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the stream suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** stream in the Version Streams configuration (Konflux Release Repo: `git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`).

This issue is **stream-scoped** to the 2.2.x stream. Steps 3-8 will be scoped to this stream for remediation task creation. Cross-stream impact on other streams (e.g., 2.1.x) will be handled via Case B (cross-stream impact comment and preemptive tasks).

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library `quinn-proto` is a Rust crate. Based on the Ecosystem Mappings table in the 2.2.x stream's security-matrix.md, this maps to the **Cargo** ecosystem.

- Lock File: `Cargo.lock`
- Check Command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`
- Upstream Branch: `release/0.4.z`
- Repository: backend

## Deployment Context Lookup

The Source Repositories table does not include a Deployment Context column. Per backward compatibility rules, all repositories default to `upstream`. Coordination guidance will be omitted from remediation task descriptions.
