# Remediation — CVE-2026-55123 (tokio)

## Triage Outcome

- **Case A**: Stream rhtpa-2.2 (in-scope) is affected — create standard remediation tasks
- **Case B**: Stream rhtpa-2.1 (out-of-scope) is also affected, and no CVE Jira exists for rhtpa-2.1 — create preemptive remediation tasks

## Case A — Standard Remediation Tasks (stream rhtpa-2.2)

Ecosystem is Cargo (source dependency) — create two tasks: upstream backport + downstream propagation.

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.2)

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)
```

**Task Description:**

## Repository

rhtpa-backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-55123: Use-after-free in task abort in tokio.
The vulnerable dependency (tokio < 1.42.0) must be updated
to the fixed version (1.42.0+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7001
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-tk91-v5pp

## Implementation Notes

- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- **Dependency type**: direct

### Remediation approach (direct dependency)

- Update tokio dependency to >= 1.42.0 in Cargo.toml / Cargo.lock
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy before
discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokio dependency is >= 1.42.0
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

---

**Post-creation:**
- Post description digest comment on the upstream task
- Link upstream task to TC-8020 with "Depend" link type

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (rhtpa-2.2)

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update rhtpa-backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)
```

**Task Description:**

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update rhtpa-backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-55123 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps tokio to 1.42.0
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- **Dependency type**: direct — carried forward from upstream task
- Update the rhtpa-backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] rhtpa-backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

---

**Post-creation:**
- Post description digest comment on the downstream task
- Link downstream task to TC-8020 with "Depend" link type
- Link downstream task as blocked by upstream task with "Blocks" link type

## Case B — Preemptive Remediation Tasks (stream rhtpa-2.1)

No CVE Jira exists for stream rhtpa-2.1. Create preemptive remediation tasks with `security-preemptive` label and "Related" link type.

### Preemptive Task 1: Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.1)

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.1)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123", "security-preemptive"]
)
```

**Task Description:**

## Repository

rhtpa-backend

## Target Branch

release/0.3.z

## Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8020 (stream rhtpa-2.2).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.

## Post-Triage Summary

After all remediation tasks are created:

1. Add `ai-cve-triaged` label to TC-8020
2. Post summary comment to TC-8020 documenting:
   - Version impact table
   - Affects Versions confirmation (RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1 — correct for stream scope)
   - Triage outcome: remediation tasks created for rhtpa-2.2 (Case A) and preemptive tasks for rhtpa-2.1 (Case B)
   - Links to all created tasks
   - @mention of the issue reporter
3. Comment footnote: sdlc-workflow/triage-security v0.13.0
