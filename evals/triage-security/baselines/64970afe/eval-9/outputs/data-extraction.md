## Custom Fields

| Custom Field | Field ID | Value |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Upstream Affected Component | customfield_10632 | webpack |
| PS Component | customfield_10669 | pscomponent:org/rhtpa-ui |
| Stream | customfield_10832 | rhtpa-2.2 |

## Stream Scope Resolution

- Summary suffix: `[rhtpa-2.2]`
- Mapped stream: **2.2.x**
- Konflux release repo: git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z
- Local path: /home/dev/repos/rhtpa-release.0.4.z
- This issue is **scoped** to the 2.2.x stream only.

## Ecosystem Detection

- Library: webpack
- Ecosystem: **npm** (JavaScript/TypeScript package)
- This is a source dependency ecosystem, so remediation would require two tasks: an upstream backport task (fix in the source repo) and a downstream propagation subtask (update the reference in the Konflux release repo).

## Vulnerability Description

A vulnerability was found in webpack. The webpack package before version 5.98.0 allows arbitrary code execution through a specially crafted loader chain configuration. An attacker with control over a project's webpack configuration can execute arbitrary code during the build process. The vulnerability exists because webpack does not properly sanitize loader paths when resolving the loader chain, allowing path traversal to execute arbitrary modules.
