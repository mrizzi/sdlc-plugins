# Remediation — TC-8020

## Case A: Standard Remediation (rhtpa-2.2 -- current stream)

The issue is scoped to stream rhtpa-2.2. Both versions in this stream (RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1) are affected. Since tokio is a Cargo (source dependency) ecosystem, two tasks are created.

### Task 1: Upstream Backport Task (rhtpa-2.2)

**Jira Creation:**

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)
```

**Description:**

```
## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-55123: tokio use-after-free in task abort.
The vulnerable dependency (tokio < 1.42.0) must be updated
to the fixed version (1.42.0+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (tokio 1.41.1), RHTPA 2.2.1 (tokio 1.41.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7001
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-tk91-v5pp

## Implementation Notes

- Update tokio dependency to >= 1.42.0 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy before
discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokio dependency is >= 1.42.0
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation Subtask (rhtpa-2.2)

**Jira Creation:**

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)
```

**Description:**

```
## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-55123 fix from <upstream-task-key>.

The upstream backport (<upstream-task-key>) bumps tokio to 1.42.0
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: <upstream-task-key> (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)
```

jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: "TC-8020",

  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Blocks"
)
```

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation (rhtpa-2.1 -- other affected stream without CVE Jira)

Stream rhtpa-2.1 is also affected (tokio 1.40.0 < 1.42.0) but has no sibling CVE Jira. Preemptive remediation tasks are created with the `security-preemptive` label and "Related" link type.

### Task 3: Upstream Backport Task -- Preemptive (rhtpa-2.1)

**Jira Creation:**

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.1)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123", "security-preemptive"]
)
```

**Description:**

```
## Repository

## Target Branch

release/0.3.z

## Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8020 (stream rhtpa-2.2).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
