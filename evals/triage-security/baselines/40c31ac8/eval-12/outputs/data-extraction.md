- Issue is **scoped** to the 2.2.x stream only

## Ecosystem Detection

- Vulnerable library: h2 (Rust crate)
- Ecosystem: **Cargo**
- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock | grep -A2 'name = "h2"'`

## Critical Observation

The Jira description provides **imprecise** version information:
- Affected versions: "versions prior to the fix" -- no specific version threshold
- Fixed version: "see advisory" -- redirects to external sources

External CVE data enrichment (Step 1.5) is required to obtain a precise fix threshold for version impact analysis.
