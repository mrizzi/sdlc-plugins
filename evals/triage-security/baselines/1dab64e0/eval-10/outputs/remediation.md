# Step 8 -- Remediation

## Triage Decision

- Issue TC-8020 is **scoped** to stream rhtpa-2.2
- Stream rhtpa-2.2: ALL versions affected -> **Case A** (create remediation tasks)
- Stream rhtpa-2.1: ALL versions affected, no sibling CVE Jira -> **Case B** (preemptive remediation)

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.2 (Current Stream)

Ecosystem: Cargo (source dependency) -> two tasks per stream (upstream backport + downstream propagation).

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.2)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`

**Description**:

```
## Repository

rhtpa-backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-55123: use-after-free in task abort in the tokio crate.
The vulnerable dependency (tokio < 1.42.0) must be updated to the fixed
version (1.42.0+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (tokio 1.41.1), RHTPA 2.2.1 (tokio 1.41.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5 (2.2.0), v0.4.8 (2.2.1)

Upstream fix: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7001
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-tk91-v5pp

## Implementation Notes

- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- **Dependency type**: direct

### Remediation approach (direct dependency)

- Update tokio dependency to >= 1.42.0 in Cargo.toml
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokio dependency is >= 1.42.0
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)
```

**Jira operations**:
```
upstream_task = jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <upstream-task-description>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)

jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: "TC-8020",
  outwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>,
  type: "Depend"
)
```

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (rhtpa-2.2)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update rhtpa-backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`

**Description**:

```
## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update rhtpa-backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-55123 fix from <upstream-task-key>.

The upstream backport (<upstream-task-key>) bumps tokio to 1.42.0
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- **Dependency type**: direct -- carried forward from upstream task
- Update the rhtpa-backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] rhtpa-backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: <upstream-task-key> (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)
```

**Jira operations**:
```
downstream_task = jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update rhtpa-backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <downstream-task-description>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)

jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>,
  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Blocks"
)

jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: "TC-8020",
  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Depend"
)
```

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.1

Stream rhtpa-2.1 is affected but has no CVE Jira. Creating preemptive remediation tasks with `security-preemptive` label and "Related" link type.

### Preemptive Task 1: Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.1)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.1)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`, `security-preemptive`

**Description**:

```
## Repository

## Target Branch

release/0.3.z

## Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8020 (stream rhtpa-2.2).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
