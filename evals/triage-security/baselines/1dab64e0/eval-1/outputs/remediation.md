# Step 8 -- Remediation

## Triage Outcome

This issue falls under **Case A** (affected -- create remediation tasks) combined with **Case B** (cross-stream impact -- proactive remediation).

- **Case A**: The scoped stream (2.2.x) has affected versions (2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2). Remediation tasks are created for the 2.2.x stream.
- **Case B**: The 2.1.x stream is also affected (all versions ship vulnerable quinn-proto). Since the issue is scoped to 2.2.x, the 2.1.x impact is cross-stream. Preemptive remediation tasks would be created for 2.1.x if no sibling CVE Jira exists for that stream.

The ecosystem is **Cargo** (source dependency), so each stream requires **two tasks**: an upstream backport task and a downstream propagation subtask.

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for 2.2.x Stream

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.2.x)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812

**Description**:

## Repository

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts (denial of service).
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.2.0 (quinn-proto 0.11.9), 2.2.1 (quinn-proto 0.11.12), 2.2.2 (retag of 2.2.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy before
discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (2.2.x)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812

**Description**:

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport task bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag, e.g., v0.4.12)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

### Jira Linkage (2.2.x tasks)

1. Link upstream task to TC-8001 with type "Depend"
2. Link downstream task to TC-8001 with type "Depend"
3. Link downstream task as blocked by upstream task with type "Blocks"

---

## Case B: Cross-Stream Impact -- Preemptive Remediation for 2.1.x

The version impact analysis shows that all 2.1.x versions (2.1.0, 2.1.1) ship quinn-proto 0.11.9, which is vulnerable. Since TC-8001 is scoped to the 2.2.x stream, the 2.1.x impact is cross-stream.

**Proposed action**: Search for an existing sibling CVE Jira for the 2.1.x stream (JQL: labels = CVE-2026-31812 AND summary ~ "rhtpa-2.1"). If no sibling exists, create preemptive remediation tasks for 2.1.x.

### Cross-stream impact comment (posted to TC-8001):

> Cross-stream impact: quinn-proto < 0.11.14 also affects stream 2.1.x based on lock file analysis. The 2.1.x stream is tracked by a companion issue (see Related links) or may require separate PSIRT triage.

### Preemptive Task 3: Upstream Backport (2.1.x, preemptive)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.1.x)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812, security-preemptive

### Jira Linkage (2.1.x preemptive tasks)

1. Link preemptive upstream task to TC-8001 with type "Related" (not "Depend", because this is cross-stream)
2. Link preemptive downstream task to TC-8001 with type "Related"
3. Link preemptive downstream task as blocked by preemptive upstream task with type "Blocks"

### Preemptive task comment (posted to TC-8001):

> Preemptive remediation tasks created for streams without CVE Jiras:
> - 2.1.x: [upstream-task-key] (security-preemptive), [downstream-task-key] (security-preemptive)
>
> These tasks use the "Related" link type and carry the security-preemptive
> label. When PSIRT creates stream-specific CVE Jiras, Step 4.4
> reconciliation will link them and remove the label.
