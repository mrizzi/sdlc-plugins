## Target Branch
main

## Bookend Type
create-branch

## Description
Create and push the feature branch `TC-9005` from the latest `main`. All subsequent implementation tasks for the "Drop status table and migrate to enum column" feature will target this branch. The feature branch is required because the migration and code changes are tightly coupled — partial delivery would leave the database or codebase in an inconsistent state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The feature branch `TC-9005` exists and is pushed to the remote
- [ ] The branch is created from the latest `main` commit

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Verify the branch `TC-9005` exists on the remote after push (`git ls-remote --heads origin TC-9005`)
